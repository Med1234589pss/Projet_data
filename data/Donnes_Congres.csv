Although numerous methods exist to support quantitative diagnosis step, there are very few materials regarding the qualitative dimension of diagnosis. Additionally, the rare existing methods are very time-intensive, need scarce expertise and often produce poor results. In a such context, the problem is how to make supply chain qualitative diagnoses impactful and fast. Practically, this paper develops a business process and its associated knowledge-based system, inspired by the theory of constraints’ thinking processes approach, to effectively support practitioners in their qualitative diagnosis step. A set of real industrial application cases is analyzed to discuss the implications of the contribution. It notably demonstrates that the proposal supports both increasing the impact of the diagnosis and reducing the time of the process by almost 80%.",English,https://imt-mines-albi.hal.science/hal-03775866,"MINES-ALBI, EMAC, CGI, IFIP, IFIP-AICT, IFIP-TC, IFIP-TC5, IFIP-WG, IFIP-WG5-5, IFIP-PROVE, INSTITUTS-TELECOM, IFIP-AICT-662, INSTITUT-MINES-TELECOM","Fouque, Anthony, Lauras, Matthieu, Benaben, Frederick, Afsarmanesh, Hamideh",Industrie du futur responsable,,,,

In addition, it must reflect the different variants and options of a family of systems. Therefore, we try to answer the following question: how to better formalize and structure knowledge for system configuration to define configuration models and use the benefits of specialization in terms of modeling? Thus, in our proposal, we introduce the elements required to formalize the knowledge and define configuration models.

We use the abilities of ontology to model knowledge of the different artifacts, their characteristics, and composition, and the abilities of CSP to model the relations between artifacts.

Even today, too few manufacturers are taking the plunge and equipping themselves internally with these new technologies. The reasons could be economic, skills-related or simply a lack of knowledge about these technologies. In this work, a methodological framework in three steps is proposed to promote appropriation of MAM processes for and by industrials. This framework has been designed from the point of view of a manufacturer who needs to produce dedicated types of parts and who seeks to select (i) the relevant MAM process and (ii) the process parameters required to reach targeted mechanical and industrial performance. This study is limited to directed energy deposition (DED) processes. First, a model to assess the maturity of DED processes was developed, based on well-known existing models such as technology readiness levels and manufacturing readiness levels. Considering their limitations, a new and innovative model was proposed for DED processes, taking into account the technology-use case couple (TUCC). It has been applied to the maturity assessment of three DED technologies coupled with three use cases (new part manufacturing, part repair and added functions to parts) and three materials (stainless steel, titanium and aluminium). Once maturity has been assessed, this study focused on the manufacturing of new parts with wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). The geometry of the AM parts and the material used (316L) are based on an industrial case study. Nine parts were manufactured varying first-order process parameters (wire feed speed and torch speed). Energy consumption, manufacturing time and quantity of raw material used have been measured in-situ. Then, destructive tests were performed providing the mechanical behaviour of 316L WAAM parts. In-situ and post-process collected data enhanced the process knowledge. Based on that, a decision support system was finally developed (i) to find Pareto optimal solutions with a genetic algorithm and (ii) to choose between these alternatives using TAMARIN, a multi-criterion ranking algorithm linked to a dynamic user interface. The proposed methodological framework has been applied to one AM process, for one use case, within specific process parameter ranges. Further investigations to transfer it to other use cases, other AM processes and other parameters are therefore wide open.",English,https://hal.science/hal-04572301,"MINES-ALBI, CNRS, IMS-BORDEAUX, EMAC, CGI, IMS-BORDEAUX-FUSION, INSTITUTS-TELECOM, INSTITUT-MINES-TELECOM","Terrenoir, Laurent, Lartigau, Julie, Laguna Salvado, Laura, Arjunan, Arun, Merlo, Christophe",Industrie du futur responsable,,,,

The sizing of the buses will allow to reduce the waiting times of flights below the level of service required by international standards.

This process was put in practice on a pilot use case with two years old data. It resulted in the identification of several decisions that could have been made if the process was in operation two years ago, which is considered as a first validation of the approach.

A major challenge for environmental managers, hence, is to efficiently balance land usebetween economic development and conservation of natural habitats. In New Caledonia, the smallestbiodiversity hotspot in the world, finding this trade-off is tedious. In particular, the conservation ofits highly diverse forest ecosystems, distinguished by high rates of endemism, can be conflicting withmining activity, the major economic sector of New Caledonia. Managers are willing to study howto refine decisional processes through the use of systematic conservation planning and computationalsustainability. To this end, we considered the project ”Cote Oublíee” started in 2016 by the environ-mental managers of the South Province of New Caledonia. It aims at delineating a complex reservesystem (including about 1200 km2 of terrestrial and 950 km2 of marine reserve) in the southeast of NewCaledonia in an area with rich biodiversity and overlapping with different socioeconomic interests (suchas 238 mining concessions, private and cultural lands, and fisheries) as well as 135 km2of area to berestored. Our objective was to identify how the reserve could be efficiently delineated while respecting socio economic constraints. More precisely, we focused on the biodiversity representation as much ason the spatial configuration of the reserve. Additionally, we aimed at reducing fragmentation throughthe identification of areas suitable for ecological restoration. Relying on a constraint-based reserveselection model, we iteratively considered operational scenarios and produced maps providing the basisfor decision support. The model was then refined according to a feedback loop between managers andscientists. Through this iterative process, we could suggest a delineation of the reserve that maximizedthe representation of biodiversity features while satisfying managers constraints. We also highlightedkey areas for reducing fragmentation through ecological restoration. This real-world pilot study showedhow systematic conservation planning can provide the basis of a decision support framework for conservation, through reserve selection models. Beyond that, it showed how the iterative use of such aframework could help to reduce the gap that can sometimes exist between scientists and managers.",English,https://hal.umontpellier.fr/hal-02313739,"CIRAD, SDE, MINES-ALBI, CNRS, INRA, AMAP, EMAC, GIP-BE, CGI, AGROPOLIS, AGREENIUM, B3ESTE, UNIV-MONTPELLIER, INSTITUTS-TELECOM, INRAE, INRAEOCCITANIEMONTPELLIER, UM-2015-2021, TEST3-HALCNRS, TEST4-HALCNRS, TEST5-HALCNRS, INEE-CNRS, INSTITUT-MINES-TELECOM","Justeau-Allaire, Dimitri, Rink, N., Lorca, Xavier, Couture, E., Birnbaum, Philippe",Souveraineté numérique et sobriété,,,,

However, accessible information about items origins or content does not meet consumers, associations and regulatory services growing expectations. Furthermore, other concerns like counterfeiting as well as bad headline pressures in case of a product recall, urge firms to develop their trace- ability systems which currently show fragilities. Indeed, today, companies manage traceability in their way which creates silos. Consequently, information flow is slowed and limited along the chain. Based on these, the study discusses the concept of ag- gregating different companies traceability management systems into a single one covering all the supply chain. The concept implementation is made possible through collaborative platforms like the Blockchain. In terms of traceability, this technology presents interests in recording transactions in a transparent, reliable and secure ways. However, it first requires data to be structured before makes it concrete. The contribution of this paper is to provide a meta model as a first groundwork for a possible Blockchain implementation for supply chain traceability purposes.

MultiCriteria analysis is based on the assumption that such ordering exists. Decision Makers are supported by several kinds of approaches or tools. One approach consists in comparing the criteria two by two, i.e. pairwise comparison, to find the relative importance of each criterion. This relative importance, called weight of criteria, is used to find the final order of alternatives. One methodology, developed by Saaty, called Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP), is based on this principle of pairwise comparison. Having the weights of criteria, the decision makers have then to compare the alternatives two by two for each criterion. Pairwise comparisons are simple to use; however, as the number of items to compare increases, so do the effort of conducting all comparisons and the probability of introducing inconsistencies. In this article we present an innovative approach to conduct pairwise comparisons based on a UI widget that resembles an interactive data plot. It uses the transitivity property of a consistent comparison matrix to infer comparisons. Our hypothesis is that this new approach is more efficient (as it reduces the number of actions the user must conduct to compare all items), more effective (as it limits the sources of inconsistencies), and yields better user satisfaction.

To anticipate and prepare for this election accurately, one of the main challenges was to confront: (i) forecasts of voter turnout, (ii) capacities of the facilities and, (iii) potential configuration options of resources. The approach chosen to conduct this anticipative study consists of collecting data about forecasts and using simulation models to work simultaneously on resource allocation and facility configuration of polling places in Fulton County, Georgia's largest county. This article presents the results of the simulations of such places facing pre-identified potential risks. These results are oriented towards the efficiency of these places according to different criteria (health, trust, comfort). Then a dynamic framework is introduced to describe risks as physical forces perturbing the efficiency of the observed system.

Particularly, Critical Infrastructures (CI - e.g., water distribution, health care) that support the daily life of societies are impacted by these disasters. These CI are indeed essential. By their various interactions and links, they become more fragile when facing complex situations. For instance, a local event, occurring in a CI (e.g., an accident), can propagate throughout these interactions, impacting other CI, leading to a higher intensity and to a global impact. Classical risks analysis is limited in terms of global and dynamic vision of these CI, to manage these events efficiently and to recover to an acceptable functioning state for the end users. To this purpose, resilience is a useful concept, highlighted by numerous research works and organizations to characterize the best way a CI has to react to an undesirable event and avoid, if possible, its propagation. The purpose of this paper is to present the main principles of a methodology to assess and analyze resilience of a CI based on a multi views and systemic model formalized as a digital twin.

Worldwide there were twice as many disasters and catastrophes in the first decade of this century as in the last decade of the 20th Century. All continents are affected, both directly and indirectly. And the trend continues, fuelled by climate change, demographic changes and social dynamics. The serious challenges facing government in cities, regions and nations of the world relate to acute shocks (such as forest fires, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, pandemics and terrorist attacks) and chronic stresses (such as high unemployment, religious extremism, inefficient public transport systems, endemic violence, chronic shortages of food and water). Information is among the key life-supporting essentials in a disaster response, as well as water and basic foods which are vital to sustain lives. It is information technology these days that gives us access to most of this information. We rely greatly on it. In this sense, information management with effective use of information systems should be conducted and evaluated among disaster relief agencies. Successful information management will result in making higher situational awareness in a field that is crucial for a disaster response. It also guides us to build a disaster-resilient community which can adapt the society to those unexpected events. These issues should be tackled at each level of the governance (international, national, regional, local, etc.), and with regards to all relevant dimensions (social, technological, interoperability, agility, etc.).

There are medications which should not be placed in neighbouring compartments because of the risk of confusion, according to medication similarity (lookalike/sound-alike drugs) or the pharmacological incompatibility which may lead to errors in dispensing. Then, the problem consists in determining the boundary conditions necessary for the allocation of medications to the different compartments without similar/incompatible medications in close proximity to one another. First, we developed an algebraic model that calculates the upper limit (not to exceed) of appearances of a medication in all pairs of incompatible medications.

Indeed, all decisions made within a company are generally aimed at maximizing the company’s value. In accounting, almost all models for assessing the value of a company are related to the amount of cash the company is able to generate. As a result, maximizing the value of a firm is usually about maximizing cash flow. However, beyond the usual accounting models, several recent initiatives have highlighted the key role of managing all assets, and not only the ones considered by the general accountability, in decision making and cash generation. Unfortunately, these methods are currently limited to conceptual and qualitative proposals that do not lead to a real decision support system thus far. This paper proposes a first step of formalization aiming at providing tools for these asset-oriented decision support approaches. The contribution is a Causal Loop Diagram to Support Decision-Making in order to maximize the value of companies. Based on a dedicated literature review, we design an asset-based causal loop model that formalizes the qualitative results of the literature review. We then develop an instantiation on an illustrative case via simulation in order to verify the relevance of the proposal and to show how such a model can be used in practice for decision making.

Despite the development in information technology, the task of extracting gene-disease associations has been mainly a manual process. This is a time-consuming process, in which experts extract gene-disease associations from relevant research papers from the literature manually. The main aim of this paper is to develop an automated approach for extracting and classifying gene-disease associations from relevant literature research papers using both natural language processing and machine learning techniques. This paper extracted data from free-text literature research papers and built four different dataset formats to discover an optimal representation. Machine and Deep learning models (NB, KNN, SVM, NN, CNN, and LSTM) with TF-IDF were applied on the built datasets.

The system aims to fill a gap in the tactical stage of the Demand Driven Adaptive Enterprise framework, where efficient decision making is complicated by both the number of evolving parameters and the number of references to deal with. By associating several process control methods into a rule-based system, we propose a first version of a decision support system and its associated knowledge base.

However, implementing such systems addresses several challenges. First, all information related to the system description and failure definition must be collected and processed. In this regard, using an expert system (ES) seems interesting. The second challenge, when monitoring complex systems, is to deal with the high volume and velocity of the input data. To reduce them, Complex Event Processing (CEP) can be used to identify relevant events, based on predefined rules. These rules can be extracted from the ES knowledge base using model transformation. This process consists in transforming some concepts from a source to a target model using transformation rules. In this paper, we propose to transform a part of the knowledge from a condition-based maintenance (CBM) model into CEP rules. After further explain ing the motivations behind this work and defining the principles behind model-driven architecture and model transformation, the transformation from a CBM model to a “generic rules” model will be proposed.

It can be used to monitor the real environment, predict its future, control its behavior, and improve its overall performance.

However, most studies on the HHCRSP are based on deterministic models that do not consider any disruptions that may compromise the execution of the schedules. In this paper, we analyze the impact of different sources of disturbances on a deterministic schedule : delays at the start of the route, variability of travel time, and variability of service processing time. Simulation has been chosen because it helps to easily model and analyze complex environments with several sources of variability. Graphical representations and an analysis of variance are presented to interpret the results, leading to several managerial insights and openings for future research.",English,https://imt-mines-albi.hal.science/hal-03926296,"MINES-ALBI, EMAC, CGI, INSTITUTS-TELECOM, INSTITUT-MINES-TELECOM","Dessevre, Guillaume, Martinez, Clea, Fontanili, Franck, Zhang, Liwen, Bortolaso, Christophe",Souveraineté numérique et sobriété,,,,

Risk definition consists in four steps. 1.Categorize the risks: 2.Risk screening[U+FF0C] 3.Risk monitoring[U+FF0C] 4.Risk diagnosis. Risk assessment can be identified as the evaluation of risk’s occurrence including an estimation of its impact. The system needs to make statistics on the impact of risks and the frequency of risks through data analysis. At this time, the risk has occurred, the system will issue an alarm, and the decision support system will intervene in the decision-making of the supply chain at this time. The decision-making suggestions made by the system are divided into four types: 1. Risk avoidance; 2. Loss control; 3. Risk transfer; 4. Risk retention. The decision support system will propose decision-making plans for supply chain managers around four core strategies, and predict the subsequent impact of various suggestions. Risk control is ensured through systematic processes, preparedness, risk awareness of employees, arti-culated procedures and elaborated plans.

In many fields, periodic maintenance actions become either insufficient or too expensive. In this context, Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) strategies, and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) in particular, are offering an interesting alternative by allowing systems to be maintained only when needed. These strategies rely on a constant monitoring and analysis of the systems operating conditions in order to detect and identify a failure when it occurs and even sometimes beforehand.Nowadays, two main approaches are explored to detect failures in PHM solutions: one based on machine learning, the other based on expertise and capitalised system knowledge.

In this case, alliance formation can be a solution for project development. Apart from simply managing complex projects, firms also find it important to increase innovativeness by sharing knowledge between partners in alliances. However, in alliances one of the difficulties is achieving effective collaboration: mis-communication, missing skills or missing resources create a high risk that the project fails to achieve its goals. In order to decrease the risk of failure, and to overcome potential collaboration inefficiency, partner selection takes place among firms that are able to communicate well while at the same time having the required knowledge to achieve their objectives. The important role of partner selection in alliances justifies the increased attention given to substantial criteria in alliance formation. Proposing a knowledge-based framework aimed at increasing the understanding of partner selection in alliances is the contribution of this paper. This knowledge can be gained by evaluating projects from a technological point of view to estimate their challenging degrees, and studying the partners background in past projects or partnerships. This paper structured to propose hypotheses based on a systematic literature review. At the heart of the hypotheses is a consideration of the needs of the project, and starting there allows us to characterize alliance formation and partner selection using a new typology.

Implementing suitable supply chain strategies is indeed crucial for enterprises seeking to strengthen their own position in the market against their competitors. With this recognition, one of the main issue in the logistic field is the suppliers and orders management, that is a complex decision-making problem depending on a wide set of aspects mutually correlated and often conflicting each other. This is the reason why assuming a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) perspective is useful to deal with the topic of interest. In particular, the present paper is aimed at sorting out a real world case study about distributing and dispatching orders, through a MCDM approach based on the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). On the one hand, this method is proposed to prioritise the vehicles used to transfer orders, by taking into account criteria such as pallet capacity, tailgate presence, energy type and so on. On the other hand, a final ranking of orders to be delivered will be achieved under the evaluation of aspects such as loading/unloading time, kind of vehicle and driver, among others.

All continents are affected, both directly and indirectly. And the trend continues, fuelled by climate change, demographic changes and social dynamics. The serious challenges facing government in cities, regions and nations of the world relate to acute shocks (such as forest fires, floods, earthquakes,tsunamis, pandemics and terrorist attacks) and chronic stresses (such as high unemployment,religious extremism, inefficient public transport systems, endemic violence, chronic shortages of foodand water).

Successful information management will result in making higher situational awareness in a field that is crucial for a disaster response.

The Physical Internet (PI) concept offers potential solutions to these issues, yet its focus has primarily been on urban and freight-oriented contexts, overlooking the unique challenges of regional transportation. Moreover, the limited analysis of regional transportation has resulted in a lack of detailed understanding of demand dynamics and difficulties in aligning supply capabilities with demand expectations. To address these issues, this paper proposes a methodology for analyzing regional transport demand, that embraces the PI concept by treating both freight and passenger demand within a unified framework. The methodology defines user profiles, characterizes demand in terms of volume, time, and space, and identifies the factors influencing transportation use. An experimental study using the ECOTRAIN project validates the effectiveness of this approach. This case study not only shows the applicability of the methodology but also highlights its potential to guide the development of tailored transportation solutions suited to regional areas.",English,https://hal.science/hal-04698452,"MINES-ALBI, EMAC, CGI, INSTITUTS-TELECOM, INSTITUT-MINES-TELECOM","Cristaldo Jimenez, Liz Araceli, Petitdemange, Eva, Lauras, Matthieu, Montreuil, Benoit",Souveraineté numérique et sobriété,,,,

Concern is even greater when considering the interconnected nature of Critical Infrastructure, which might lead to failure propagation, causing domino and cascade effects. To mitigate such outcomes, critical infrastructure must recover its capacity to function with regard to several criteria. Stakeholders must therefore analyse and improve the resilience of critical infrastructure before any disruption occurs, and base this analysis on different models so as to guarantee society’s vital needs. Current resilience assessment methods are mainly oriented towards the context of a single system, thus narrowing their criteria metrics, limiting flexibility and adaptation to other contexts, and overlooking the interconnected nature of systems.

To this end, we study the transposition of the well-known Supply Chain Operations Reference model (SCOR) to educational systems which manage flows of learners. Indeed, the path that a learner follows is a succession of business processes from one educational organization to another that constitute an educational chain that could be improved through the Educational Supply Chain Operations Reference (EducSCOR) model we developed in this paper.

By simplifying the response to potential changes and maintaining stakeholder involvement throughout the process, the platform addresses the aforementioned challenges. This article establishes a correlation between SM platform concepts and BPM concepts, emphasizing how they facilitate the concurrent design and execution of BPs. Furthermore, the article demonstrates the application of the SM platform in implementing the agility framework through a use case analysis involving a scientific paper submission process. To overcome the current emphasis on stakeholder involvement and human capabilities in applying the platform, we finally explore the possibilities of employing AI agents as automated assistants. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",English,https://imt-mines-albi.hal.science/hal-04417906,"MINES-ALBI, EMAC, CGI, INSTITUTS-TELECOM, TOULOUSE-INP, UT3-INP, UT3-TOULOUSEINP, LGP-ENIT, INSTITUT-MINES-TELECOM","Majidian Eidgahi, Mehran, Barthe-Delanoë, Anne-Marie, Bork, Dominik, Namaki Araghi, Sina, Macé-Ramète, Guillaume, Benaben, Frederick",Souveraineté numérique et sobriété,,,,

However, the development of such algorithms depends on the presence of a sufficiently large amount of data to provide reliable results. Unfortunately in medicine, it is not always possible to provide so much data on all pathologies. This problem is particularly true for rare diseases. In this paper we focus on uveitis, a rare disease in ophthalmology which is the third cause of blindness worldwide. This pathology is difficult to diagnose because of the disparity in prevalence of its etiologies. In order to provide physicians with a diagnostic aid system, it would be necessary to have a representative dataset of epidemiological profiles that have been studied for a long time in this domain. This work proposes a breakthrough in this field by suggesting a methodological framework for the generation of an open source dataset based on the crossing of several epidemiological profiles and using data augmentation techniques. The results of these generated synthetic data have been qualitatively validated by specialist physicians in ophthalmology.

To convince humanitarian actors to embrace this path, we propose a rigorous methodology leveraging a prototypical agent-oriented discrete-events simulator built within the AnyLogic platform, to conduct scientific experiments enabling to investigate the suitability and relevance of PI concepts for HSCs by systematically quantifying their benefits and drawbacks on HSC performance, sustainability, and resilience. We provide preliminary experimental results contrasting the baseline shaped by the current HSC structures, behaviors and practices, notably relative to sourcing, transporting, and warehousing, with those of hyperconnected HSCs in line with the Physical Internet at distinct degrees of maturity. In the experiment, we study past disaster scenarios that occurred in Indonesia and response efforts under different behaviors simulated with this platform.

However, the impact of this shift on the humanitarian supply chain's performance, particularly readiness, has been understudied. To address this issue, a simulation-based assessment of hyperconnected humanitarian supply chains' response readiness is conducted.

The flooded area as a system has components of (i) the flood (e.g. time of onset, magnitude, intensity, etc.), (ii) the area (e.g. geographical features, temporary perimeter barriers, dam, diversion canals), and (iii) the community (e.g. reaction time, emergency strain, evacuation delay).

The interaction is done thanks to queries to the system: The decision-maker makes partial choices and asks about the consequences in terms of costs but also about possible inventory levels. Hence, three fundamental queries are investigated: Find production plans with a cost less than K; Find possible plans with conditioning on a pair of variables (production and inventory); Find the production plans that simultaneously satisfy the previous queries. A knowledge compilation approach is used and composed of two phases: offline and online. Offline, a top-down algorithm computes cost multivalued decision diagrams. While online, we show how cost multivalued decision diagrams can improve the reactivity of answers to queries. The proposed approach is compared to classical constraint programming with CP Optimizer.
